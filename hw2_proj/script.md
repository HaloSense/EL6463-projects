## Counter A

I will now demonstrate the functions of counter A. The reset switch is switch 0 and the enable switch is switch 1.

When reset is 1, the counter value is set to 1, the first digit of my N number. When reset is 0 and enable is 1, the counter starts counting up. When enable is 0, the counter stops. Whenever reset turns 1, the counter is set back to 1.

## Counter B

This is the second counter B.

When reset is 1, the counter value is set to 3, the last digit of my N number. When reset is 0 and enable is 1, the counter starts counting down. When enable is 0, the counter stops. Whenever reset turns 1, the counter is set back to 3.
