# HW4 Report

My design process:

1. Draw the datapath design, based on the lecture slides. The length of report is likely to exceed if the images are inserted, so I enclosed them in the folder.

2. Decide what implementation structure to use. The idea of FSM didn't cross my mind at first, but after discussing about it with some of the classmates, I figured that it can be realized with FSM. But my design was almost completed by then, so I didn't switch to FSM.

3. Write codes and realize the functions.

4. Generate test cases and write testbenches. I generated 105 64-bit (16 characters) hexadecimal data, retrieved the encode result with the provided python script, and used these as the plaintext/ciphertext combinations.
